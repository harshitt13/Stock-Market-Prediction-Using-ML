## Project Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model using two different machine learning approaches: Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to provide predictive insights into stock price movements using historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

## Features

- Automated stock data retrieval using `yfinance`
- Two prediction models:
  - Linear Regression
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
- Comprehensive data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparative analysis of prediction performance

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Tensorflow
- PyTorch
- yfinance
- pandas
- numpy
- Matlpotlib
- joblib
- sklearn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock_Analysis_Prediction_Model.git
cd Stock_Analysis_Prediction_Model
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Fetching Stock Data

To fetch historical stock data:
```bash
python src/fetch_data.py
```

### Training Models

To train both Linear Regression and LSTM models:
```bash
python src/stock_prediction.py
```

### Running Predictions

To run predictions and compare model performance:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Model Comparison

The project compares two machine learning models:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple, interpretable model
   - Works well with linear relationships
   - Faster training time

2. **LSTM Neural Network**
   - Captures complex temporal dependencies
   - Better at handling sequential data
   - More complex architecture

## Performance Metrics

The performance of each model is evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R²) Score

Detailed performance metrics are visualized in the `pictures/` directory.

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify model and data processing functionality:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Limitations

- Stock predictions are inherently probabilistic
- Model performance depends on market conditions
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
